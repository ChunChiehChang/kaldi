This directory contains example scripts for image classification with the Imagenet 2012 competition dataset.

So far the scripts in this directory are incomplete.
Everything called from "run.sh" is done.
Still need to finish changing code to deal with multiple image sizes.
Will need to edit things in "steps" directory.
